1: Ordered lists:
Lists where each item in the list is numbered. 
E.g: THe list might be a set of steps for a recipe that
must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point
needs to be identified by a section number.

2: Unordered lists:
Are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order)

3: Definition lists:
Are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for
each of those terms.


Conclusions:
1: There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, 
unordered, and definition.

2: Ordered lists use numbers.

3: Unordered lists use bullets.

4: Definition lists are used to define terminology.

5: Lists can be nested inside one another.
