<blockquote>
The <blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up
an entire paragraph. Note how the <p> element is still used inside
the <blockquote>element.
Browsers tend to indent the contents of the <blockquote> elemnt, however you should not use this element just to indent a piece of
text --rather you should achieve this effect using CSS.


<q>
The <q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the <q>
element, however Internet Explorer does not -
therefore many people avoid it.
