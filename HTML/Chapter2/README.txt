When creating a web page, you add tags
(known as markup) to the contents of the page.
These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure
for the page.

In this chapter we focus on how to add markup to text that appears on your pages. You will learn about:

Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.

Semantic markup: Which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on...


Conclusions:
1: HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page
(e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
2: They also provide semantic information(e.g. where emphasis should
be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is
a quotation.)
