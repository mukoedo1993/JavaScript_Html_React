Several things to consider:
	1: Include an image in your web pages using HTML
	2: Pick which image format to use
	3: Show an image at the right size
	4: Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages
	load faster


Conclusions:
1: The <img> element is used to add images to
a web page.

2: You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.

3: You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

4:Photograpgs are best saved as JPEGs; illusrations or logos that use flat colors are
better saved as GIFs.
