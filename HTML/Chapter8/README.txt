Each new version was designed to
be an improvement on the last (with new elements and attributes added
and older code removed).

There have also been several version of each browser used to
view of each browser used to view web pages, each of which implements
new code. Not all web users, however, have the latest browsers installed
on their computers, which means that not everyone will be able to view all
of the latest features and markup.

Where you should be particularly aware of browsers not supporting certain features.
I have made a note of this(as you have seen with some of the HTML5 elements introduced in the
Forms chapter --and as you will see in the CSS chapters.)
