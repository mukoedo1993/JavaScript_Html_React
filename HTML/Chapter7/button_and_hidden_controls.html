<!--
BUTTON:
The <button> element was introduced to allow users more control
over how their buttons appear, and to allow other elements to appear
inside the button.

INPUT:
type="hidden"
The example also shows a hidden form control. These form controls are
not shown on he page (although you can see them if you use the View Source
option in the browser). They allow web page authors to add values to forms that users cannot see.
