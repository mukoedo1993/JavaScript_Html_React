FORM:
Form controls live inside a <form> element.
This element should always carry 
ACTION: 
Every form element requires an action attribute. 
Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will
receive the information in the form when it is submitted.
METHOD:
Forms can be sent using one of twomethods: get or post.
get method: the values from the form are added to the end of 
the URL specified in the action attribute.

post method:  With the post method the values are sent in what are
known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should use the post metho
if you form: 

id:
We look at the id attribute on page 183
, but the value is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements
on the page (and is often used by scripts --such as those that check you have 
entered information into fields 
that require values).
