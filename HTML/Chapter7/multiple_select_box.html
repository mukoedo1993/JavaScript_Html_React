 <!--
 size:
 You can turn a drop down select box into a box
 that shows more than one option by adding the size
 attribute. Its value should be the number of options you
 want to show at once.
 
 
 multiple:
 You can allow user to select multiple options from this
 list by adding the multiple attribute with a value of
 multiple.
 It is a good idea to tell users if they can select more than
 one option at a time. It is also helpful to indicate that on a PC
 they should hold down the control key while selecting multiple options
 and on a Mac they should use the command key while selecting options.
