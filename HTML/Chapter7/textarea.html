<p>What do you think of this gig?</p>
<textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="4">Enter 
your comments...</textarea>
</form>

<!--
The textarea element is used to create a multi-line text input.
Unlike other input elements this is not an empty element. It should therefore
have an opening and closing tag.

Any text that appears between the opening <textarea> and closing </textarea>
tags will appear in the text box when the page loads.
