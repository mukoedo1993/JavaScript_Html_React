 INPUT
 The size attribute should not be used on new forms.
 It was used in older forms to indicate the width of the
 text input.
 
 type="text"
 When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a 
 singleline text input.
 
 name
 When users enter information into a form, the server needs to
 know which form control each piece of data was entered into.
 
 maxlength
 You can use the maxlength attribute to limit the number of characters
 a user may enter into the text field.
