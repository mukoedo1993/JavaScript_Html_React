Understanding CSS:
Thinking inside the box:
The key to understanding how CSS works
is to imagine that there is an invisible box around
every HTML element

CSS ASSOCIATES STYLE RULES WITH HTML ELEMENTS
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules
govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed.
A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.

Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector
should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts(a property
and a value), and are separated by a colon.

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of
two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
