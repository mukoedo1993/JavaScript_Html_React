<p id="intro">There are <i>dozens</i> of different
<b>potato</b> varieties.</p>
<!--
The b tag specifies bold text without any extra importance.-->
<p>They are usually described as early, second early
and maincrop potatoes.</p>
<!--

    If the two selectors are identical,
    the latter of the two will take precedence. Here you can see
    the second i selector takes precedence over the first.

    Specificity:
    If one selector is more speicifc than the others, the more
    specific rule will take precedence over
    more general ones.

    Important:
    You can add !important after
    any property value to indicate that it should
    be considered more important than other rules
    that apply to the same element.
