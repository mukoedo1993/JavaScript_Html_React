<!--

The font-family property 
specifies the font for an element.

-->

 <!--
h1{
        border: 1px solid #665544;
        background-color: #efefef;
        padding: inherit;}



            An element's padding is the space between its content and its border 
            -->
<!--
    If you specify the font-family or color
    properties on the <body> element, they will
         apply tomost child elements. This is because
         the value of the font-family property is inherited
         by child elements. It saves you from having to
         apply these properties to as many elements.(and results in
         simpler style sheets)

         You can compare this with the background-color or border
         properties; they are not inherited by child elements.
       
         You can force a lot of properties to inherit values from
         their parent elements by using inherit for the value of the properties.

         In this example, the div element called page inherits
         the padding size from the CSS rule that applies to the body element.
