 BODY:
 You met the body element in the first example we created.
 Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser 
 window.
 -->
 
 <!--
 HEAD:
 Before the <body> element you will often see a <head> element. This contains
 information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the 
 main part of the browser window that is highlighted in blue on the opposite
 page)
 You will usu. find a <title> element inside the <head> element.
 -->
 
 <!--
 TITLE:
 The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser,
 above where you usu. type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the 
 tab for that page(if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages
 at the same time)
