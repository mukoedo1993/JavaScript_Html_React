 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
    the page. And if the page is a long one it might
    be split up into several sub-headings.</p>
 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you 
 follow the structure of what is being written.
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level 
 headings).</p>
 <h2>Another Sub-headings</h2>
 <p>Here you can see another Sub-heading</p>

<!--
The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets --these are called HTML elements. 
ELEMENTS:
Elements are usually made up of two
tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser sth about the information that
sits between its opening and closing tags.
