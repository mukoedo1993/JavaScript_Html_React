Struture:

Relationships:
The relationship between files and folders
on a website is described using the same terminology
as a family tree.

Homepages:
The main homepage of a site written in HTML (and the
homepages of each section in a 
child folder) is called index.html

Web servers are usu. set up to return the index.html if no
file name is specified.
Every page and every image on a website has a URL(or Uniform 
Resource Locator). The URL is made up of the domain name followed
by the path to that page or image.
The path to the homepage of this site is www.examplearts.com/index.html. The path to the logo for the site is examplearts.com/images/logo.gif

Conclusions:
1:Links are created using the <a> element.
2: The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the
page you are linking to.
3: If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best
to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
4: You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
5: You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that
can be linked to.
